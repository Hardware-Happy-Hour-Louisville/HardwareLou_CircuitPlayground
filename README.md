Circuit Playground Demos &amp; Tutorials for Louisville Hardware Meetup

## Getting Started

Each directory has two sets of code files. 

- `.ino` files are Arduino source files
- `.py` files are CircuitPython source files

While the hardware can be used with Arduino and CircuitPython the libraries,
bootloader and tools are different. 

If you plan on using Arduino based tooling get started [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/arduino)

For CircuitPython start [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-quickstart)

## Example Overviews

- Snap
  - The board listens for a loud noise (SNAP!) and changes the pattern and color of the neopixels.
  
- Neopixel Play
  - Adjust the color of the neopixels using the boards touch pads.
  
- Keyboard
  - Use the capacitive touch pads to play a keyboard. 
  
- Cricket
  - The board makes noises based on how much light the sensor detects.
  
## CircuitPlayground Library Reference Docs
The CircuitPlayground boards have libaries available for both Arduino and CircuitPython
that make interacting with the boards sensors easier.
